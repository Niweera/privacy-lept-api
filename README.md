# Privacy-Lept System

Privacy-Lept System is a play on words where the system will literally zero your privacy where it will show when you are online and from which device you are connecting to the internet. Why I built this? No clue; I just wanted to show anyone who visits my personal website https://niweera.gq that I am online or offline. Also, I just wanted to try to do something I've never done ðŸ˜‚. 

Privacy-Lept System is consisted with three components.

1. [Privacy-Lept-Desktop](https://github.com/Niweera/privacy-lept-desktop) (Windows service)

2. [Privacy-Lept-Mobile](https://github.com/Niweera/privacy-lept-app) (Android application)

3. [Privacy-Lept-API](https://github.com/Niweera/privacy-lept-api) (Socket.io NodeJS Express App)

When I'm online, from Desktop and Mobile, it will notify the Privacy-Lept-API and the Privacy-Lept-API will notify my website using [socket.io](https://socket.io/). 

## Privacy-Lept-API

This is the API for the Privacy-Lept system. It is developed in TypeScript using Express and Socket.io. The system is online on https://online.niweera.gq.

### Setup

```bash
$ npm i -g pm2
$ npm i
$ npm run compile

# Development
$ npm run serve

# On Production (PM2 will handle the serving of the API)
$ pm2 start
```
